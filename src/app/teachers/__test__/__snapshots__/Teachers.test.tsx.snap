                Joshua started playing piano at the age of 6 and took piano lessons for 8 years. Since then, he’s been a self-taught performer/composer who played in several orchestras, weddings, and public gigs. He is experienced in teaching students funk, gospel, classical, and video game/movie music. However, he is most specialized in teaching ear-playing, improvisation, music production, and composition theory. He highly believes that the student’s goals come first and will work his lessons around what his students want to achieve. He is also able to arrange custom sheet music for students, even for songs that have no existing piano sheets available. Joshua is currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Economics, with a minor in music and computer science at San Jose State University.
