              Absolutely! Everyone has to start somewhere and many of our students have never had any previous musical training. Part of the excitement of doing what we do is shaping new musicians into lifelong learners who want to gain more skill and confidence in their art.

              We offer ½-hour, ¾-hour and 1-hour lessons. For a 5-10-year-old just getting started, a half hour is a good start. If the student is really showing interest and their attention span can handle it, you may want to consider a 3/4-hour or 1-hour lesson to see quicker progress. For 10 years old and above, we believe students can make more progress with a ¾-hour or 1-hour lesson, as long as they practice often and consistently. After our free trial lesson, we can make a more educated suggestion based on the student’s goals and needs.

              After you fill out the contact form, we will contact you to learn more about your musical instruction needs. We will then make our best suggestion as to which teacher might be the best fit. Our teachers are hired for their ability to connect and adapt to varied students’ needs, in addition to their proven musical proficiency. You can also browse our teachers on our roster page and share your teacher preferences. Other factors that go into a student-teacher match are your location and mutually agreeable schedules lining up.

              Learning to play an instrument is best done when exposure to it is consistent, so we expect consistency in our students’ attendance. However, we understand that things happen that are out of your control, and offer reasonable flexibility to miss lessons on occasion. For details regarding cancellations, refer to our lesson policies.

              We recommend going to a local music store and presenting that same question. The student should be present to make sure the guitar is a comfortable fit for them. Also, let the representative know what kind of music the student likes and the budget you have to spend on an instrument. From our experience, electric guitars are easier to play in the beginning, which is the crucial point where you want to make it as easy as possible for your child to progress with confidence. Unless he or she is going to be playing Classical, we suggest the electric guitar. Fender guitars are good starters for both electric and acoustic guitars.

              We know the importance of allowing young musicians the opportunity to grow in their art. Live performances offer an opportunity to show their loved ones how they have advanced in their playing, as well as an opportunity to feel more comfortable playing in front of an audience. With 2-3 recital opportunities given each year, we aspire to create a warm, encouraging atmosphere at our shows so that our students enjoy their experience and gain self-confidence in the process of performing.
