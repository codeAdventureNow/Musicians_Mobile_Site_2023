                It felt nice to see smiles on the wonderful audience’s faces. Archis and Ronan worked hard and loved every minute.
              </span>
               Please do let us know of future opportunities like this. I would love for them to participate. Archis is really loving the singing part of it and Ronan being so little is enjoying sitting at the piano for hours and practicing. Thanks again! You have a great team. We absolutely love Liana and Jared is really great .”
